A sandbox simulation of the solar system featuring time stepping, gravity simulations between all celestial bodies, mass and velocity shifting and movement of any and all objects.
Meant to give a greater appreciation for how beautiful the balance of our solar system is, and how delicately our planet lies among the gravity of our star.
